# Thanks for showing your interest in YouTube!

I am perfectly happy to take pull requests for new features, however, they must follow these guidelines:

+ Be useful
  - I don't want pointless code
+ Don't be blocking
  - Use `async` and `aiohttp` where possible
+ Not be malicious in any way
+ Not be abusive of API tokens

As well as this, if you notice a security loophole, such as a token left public, PLEASE MESSAGE ME AND LET ME KNOW. **DO NOT TRY TO EXPLOIT IT.**
